# About my project

**SciCAFE**: It is a web portal that helps to foster a community for stuents and faculty engaged in Science(STEM) activities.My project divide serveral homeworks, written in different languange, web framework and database. Now I finished backend parts, mainly focus on RESTapi. In the future I will still work on nodejs, express framework, mongoose database and finish front side by Angular.  

# What I do

**hw2**: class design(add ER relation) and use JPA(java) annotations to map the model classes to a relational schema. Database(mySQL) access by Hibernate. 

**hw3**: Implement REST api operations by using Spring framework. Use Spring MockMvc and postman application to do tests.

**exe5**: Store information and query the specific data in promise function or callback function by using MongoDB shell script, nodejs with MongoDB driver and nodejs with Mongoose. 

**hw4**: class with mongoose scheme and use express framework to implement REST api and handle authentication and authorization. Then, use postman application to check json output and modify header (jwt), and pass test case in Jasmine.
